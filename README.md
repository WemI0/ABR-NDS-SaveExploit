Asterix Brain Trainer Nintendo DS Savegame Exploit
====
Stack Smash I found in the game, will you allow you to run a (very) small payload at the address 0xAC of the savegame.

This is a NTR/NDS-Mode Exploit type, and the size of the payload must not exceed
0xD0 (the savegame is really small), so you got it, it's pretty useless.
I did this just to learn more about exploit stuff.

Special thanks to CTurt for the payload code, all I did was to find the exploit and the CRC calculation of the savegame.

It was only tested for the EU version of the game.


### How to trigger the exploit

To trigger the exploit, you just need to touch the bottom screen once the game loaded.
